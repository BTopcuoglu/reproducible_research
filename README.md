Hi everyone,

I am looking forward to working with you next week as part of the MICRBIOL 612.1 module on reproducible research. There are two papers that I'd like you to read ahead of time...

Ravel J, Wommack KE. All hail reproducibility in microbiome research. Microbiome. 2014 Mar 7;2(1):8. doi: 10.1186/2049-2618-2-8.

Noble WS. A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects. PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Jul;5(7):e1000424. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424.

[ Include the mBio wrap up from the symposium ]

Please download and install the following prior to the workshop. I'll try to be there a bit early if people need help installing stuff.

	Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press [Enter])
	Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
	setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
	Press [Enter], you should see SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.
