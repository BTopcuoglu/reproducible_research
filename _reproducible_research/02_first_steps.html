# First Steps for the Reproducible Research Novice

---

## Learning goals

* Conclude that reproducible research is a continual process with no end
* Identify and order the populations that need your research to be reproducible
* Evaluate initial steps you can take to make your research more reproducible
* Explore interfaces that can make your research more reproducible
* Write a simple document in markdown
* Use version control without knowing it

---

## Baby steps

* Don't feel like you need to make everything 100% reproducible in your first go

--
* You will quickly realize that is a fool's errand - **nothing** will ever be fully reproducible

--
* With each project, attempt to add one small element to make your work more reproducible

---

## First steps to reproducibility

* ORCID

* Post data behind your figures

* Making your code publicly available

???

If you get nothing else out of this workshop, these three steps will significantly enhance your ability to perform reproducible science

---

## ORCID

* Why:
  * Will your current email address be any good in 10 years?
  * Ties in other services (e.g. ImpactStory, LinkedIn, ResearchGate)
  * It's free!
* How:
  * https://orcid.org

## Post data behind your figures


* What's wrong with posting data on a private server?
--

* Sequence data and metadata must be posted to SRA
--

* Other data should be posted to stable web server (e.g. FigShare)
  * Provides DOIs for each set of data
  * Prohibits user from deleting data
  * Is free (within limits)
--

* Can you find the [FigShare accession](https://figshare.com/articles/Lillis_Classroom_Surfaces/687155) from Meadows et al?

---

## Making your code publicly available

* Make a [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account and log in

???

You might take a minute and think of a good GitHub handle for your account. Many people bemoan the fact that they have separate GitHub, email, and Twitter handles. The handles don't work across platforms, it is often easier for you - and your friends - to keep track of you if you are consistent.

---

## Making your code publicly available

* Create a new repository

.middle.center[![Your new home in GitHub]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/github-user-home.png)]

???

When you log in to GitHub you'll see a "+" at the top right corner of the window, click on this, and then select "New Repository"

---

## Making your code publicly available

.middle.center[![GitHub sign up page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/github-create-new-repository.png)]

???

Here we'll create a new repository - possibly your first - how exciting!
* Insert a name for your repository. Try to make it meaningful. For our papers we give them names that start FirstAuthorLastName_OneWordDescriptionOfPaper_Journal_Year. For example, Sze_Obesity_mBio_2016 was a paper published in mBio during 2016 that Marc Sze wrote on obesity and the microbiome (this can be changed later)
* Add a one line description of your project (this can be changed later)
* Select "Public". GitHub gives out repositories for free if they are public. You can email them to set up an academic account, which will give you unlimited Private accounts. Be sure to make them Public before you submit your manuscripts
* Check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README"
* Select the "MIT License" in the right hand side scroller
* Click "Create repository"

## Making your code publicly available

.middle.center[![GitHub new repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/github-new-repository.png)]

???

Well done! You have your first repository created. You can actually do quite a bit without knowing
any git. Let's try out some things...

---

## Making your code publicly available

.middle.center[![GitHub new repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/github-edit-readme.png)]

???

* Click on the blue `README.md` link in the middle of your repository screen and then click on the pencil in the upper right corner of the box.
* Toggle between the "Edit file" and "Preview changes" tab - Change the '`# rr_practice`' to '`# README`'

---

## Making your code publicly available

* A file ending in `md` indicates that it is a file in "markdown" format
* This is a text file (*not a Word file*)
* There are simple "markups" that you can do to add formatting to the text

---
## Making your code publicly available

* You can explore [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) further
* Make the following changes and toggle back and forth from the preview...
  * `#` to `##` or `###`
  * `efforts` to `*efforts*`, `**efforts**`, `***efforts***`, or `~~efforts~~`
  * Add a bulleted list

---

## Exercise

* Edit the README.md file
	* Give the file a more descriptive title using a `#` header
	* Write today's date on a separate line
	* Write instructions for how to fold a paper airplane
* Look at the bottom of the README.md page
  * In the narrow box below "Commit changes" enter a brief description of what you changed in the file
  * In the larger box, write a more detailed description
  * Press the green "Commit changes" box

---

## Exercise

* Send a link to your repository to a neighbor and ask them to follow the directions.
* Revise your instructions based on your neighbor's success or failure.
* "Commit" the change

---

## Debrief

* What were the challenges to reproducibly making a paper airplane?

--
* What would improve your ability to improve the reproducibility?

--
* How does a tool like GitHub help to make your method more reproducible?

--
* What might you do with your neighbor's repository?

--
* Was this easy or difficult?

???

* Pictures, video, better description
* Can hopefully appreciate that GitHub fosters collaboration and transparency
* The repository is a living document that continue to change and develop long after the paper is published
* The repository also becomes an avenue to build upon the original method. Imagine...
  * Making a collection of paper airplane models
  * Modifying a model to make a more sophisticated paper airplane
  * Modifying instructions to make construction more efficient

---

## Introspection

* Think about a figure from the last paper you wrote or that was in your favorite paper
* What would you need to tell someone else how to create the figure?
* What would be the benefits of creating a "script" to tell someone how to generate the figure?
* What would be the challenges?
