* This workshop started as an April Fool's joke - a command for the mothur software package that would write a paper for people based on inputted data.

* This workshop makes that joke a reality

* If only it were as simple as this!

## Recurring themes

.left-column[
* If you can satisfy these "collaborators", you will satisfy most reviewers.
  * You are your most important collaborator
  * Your PI is your second most important collaborator
* Reproducible research methods are preventative medicine

## Topics and tools we'll cover

* Documentation (`markdown`, `Rmarkdown`, `R`, `make`, `git`)
* Organization (`bash`, HPC/AWS, `git`)
* Automation (`bash`, `R`, `make`)
* Transparency (ORCID, FigShare, `git`, GitHub, open source licensing)
* Collaboration (`git`, GitHub, open source licensing)

???

The topics are far more important than the tools

## Tools we'll use but not go deep on...

* `R` - see [minimal R tutorial](http://www.riffomonas.org/minimalR/)
* `mothur` - see [mothur MiSeq SOP](https://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP)

## Questions...

* What about your current data analysis pipelines makes you feel uncomfortable?
* If you left your project for six months, how difficult would it be to restart?
* How easily is your PI able to interact with your analysis?
