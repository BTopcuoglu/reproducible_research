## Learning goals

* **Primary:** Justify the use of keeping track of the evolution of an analysis

--

* **Secondary:**
	* Differentiate between analog and digital version control approaches
	* Construct meaningful descriptions of differences between versions
	* Integrate git and GitHub tooling to improve documentation of the evolution of an analysis
  * Articulate the benefits of a dedicated version control system

---

## Learning outcomes

* Apply version control to your project
* Look through the history of a project to see how a file has changed

---

## Survey: Do you keep track of different versions of things?

* Do you back up your data or your code? Where? How?
* When have you needed to go to a backup?

???
* If they accidentally delete something
* If they somehow introduce a bug
* Dropbox / Box

---

## Survey: What is your current system for working with multiple versions?

* How do you keep track of different versions of your project?
* Where are these versions kept?
* How do you compare different versions?
* Do you know the differences between the versions?
* How difficult would it be to go back to a previous version?

???
* Expect things like track changes or compare versions in Word (not helpful for Excel)

## Case study: Scenario

As an graduate student you were taught proper methods for keeping a laboratory notebook. You were perhaps told to give each experiment a title, rationale, hypothesis, description of methods, data, results, and a conclusion. Now you have been given a project that involves analyzing 10 million 16S rRNA gene sequences. How will you change your lab notebook practices?

---

## Case study: Questions

* How have you handled this situation in the past?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches?
* What if you needed to change a parameter setting or add new data?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of paper vs. electronic notebooks for bench and computational science?

* An early computational notebook that I still have
* My heart was there, but something wasn't quite right

## Case study: Drafting a manuscript

.left-column[
You are working on a manuscript and send it out to your PI. They're taking longer than hoped to get you feedback. In the meantime, you incorporate some comments from your labmates. Now you have a mess.

What do you typically do in this situation?

* Both of these circumstances are prime opportunities to use git.
* A major difficulty with this, however, is teaching collaborators how to use git or GitHub
* I don't have any silver bullets to solve the issue with collaborators, but throughout this tutorial and others we'll see some strategies make it easier

* **Presentation:** git; simple workflows, the log, navigating the history,
  branches (30 min)

* **Activity:** Using git to track changes in formatting; go back through
  history; branches (45 min)
