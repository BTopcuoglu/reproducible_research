**Autotutorial 1: The importance of reproducible research and its relevance to
studying the human microbiome**


***Rationale:*** Very few published microbiome studies can be easily reproduced
based on the level of detail provided in the published paper {Ravel, 2014 #3356}.
In some cases, it is not possible to access the raw data and associated
metadata. Thus, it is critical to start the module by establishing the
importance of reproducible research.


***Incoming:***

* *Knowledge:* At least a general familiarity with scientific method and
  microbiome research
* *Misconceptions:*

  * Data and methods should be shrouded to protect research group from
    competitors
  * "My lab's papers don't have a reproducibility problem"  


***Conceptually difficult content:*** The idea that a lack of reproducibility
does not necessarily indicate bad science or fraud. Rather, it limits one's
ability to assess the underlying science and the ability to move the science
forward.


***Learning goals:***

* *Primary:* Understand that reproducible research refers to the ability of
  another researcher to use your methods to reproduce your results
* *Secondary:*

  * Be able to articulate the causes and possible solutions for the lack of
  reproducibility in microbiome research
  * Appreciate that an inability to reproduce another researcher's results
  limits the ability to build off of that work


***Learning outcomes:***

* Articulate the importance of making raw data and detailed methods accessible
* Identify various technologies as solutions to practices that limit
  reproducibility


***Activities (~2 hrs):***

* **Introduction:** Definitions
* **Reflection:** What are the areas of microbiome research that are most
  prone to limit reproducibility? (5 min)
* **Case study 1:** Lab publishes a paper and gets inundated by emails asking
  about the nitty gritty of the methods. The trainee that did the study has gone
  on to a new job. This is an example of the common problem in microbiome
  research (10 min)
* **Presentation:** Describe of the recent history highlighting problems in
  reproducibility across science and in the microbiome literature (20 min).
* **Go explore:** Ravel and Wommack editorial from Microbiome (10 min)
* **Case study 2:** Student finds Meadow et al. IPython
  notebook and wants to do a secondary analysis. This is an example of a good
  practice in microbiome research (10 min)
* **Go explore:** Read and analyze a recent microbiome paper to identify where
  there are possible limitations to reproducibility (20 min)
* **Presentation:** Identify areas that are the most prone to limiting
  reproducibility and provide a technology overview that links technologies
  to specific hurdles in terms of insuring reproducibility (20 min).
* **Go explore:** Create accounts at GitHub (20 min)
* **Extend:** Perform an audit of your research group's most recent publications
  and score them for their reproducibility using a supplied checklist


***Assessments:***

* Initial responses to the Reflection activity
* Matching task linking failure to reproduce results to a practice/technology
  discussed in the Presentations
* How many reproducibility hurdles can they identify in the microbiome paper?
* Evidence that they created the GitHub, FigShare, and DataDryad accounts
* Time spent on case studies and presentations
* Indication from future publications that practices have changed
