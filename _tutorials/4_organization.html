## Noble paper on file organization

---

## Compare file organization from two projects

* Examples
	* [Meadows et al. *Microbiome* study](https://github.com/jfmeadow/Meadow_etal_Surfaces/)
	* [Westcott & Schloss *mSphere* study](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Westcott_OptiClust_mSphere_2017/)
* Questions
	* What do you notice about the structure of the two projects?
  * How long did it taketo find the code for Figure 1?
  * Where is the main document?
	* Where would the data go?

---

## An aside about large files

* GitHub cannot easily handle large datasets
* Each file is limited to 100 MB and a repository is limited to 1 GB
* Generally only post the data files critical to an analysis
* Scripts should document where data goes and how it gets there
* We'll talk more about git/GitHub later

* You are free to do what you want, but keep to the basic priniciples outlined in the Noble paper
* You'll see this again when we discuss the `new_project` repository

## Bad project: Introduction

.center[

]

* You have inherited a project from a previous student in the lab
* You need to organize it into a logical structure

---

## Bad project: Exercise

* [Download the data](https://github.com/riffomonas/bad_project/archive/v0.1.zip) to a new directory `~/Documents/bad_project`
* Using the recommended directory structure, move files to the appropriate folders
  * Remember that you can use `mv current_file directory/` to move `current_file` into `directory/`
  * Don't forget the `/` after `directory`

## Bad project: Evaluation

* Compare your results to your neighbor
* Once you are done, run `find . | diff - .solution` to compare your results to mine
* What do you notice? Do you agree with my organization?

---

## Using a project template

* The structure of most microbiome analysis projects is fairly standard
* To help with the structure, we created a template, [`new_project`](https://github.com/SchlossLab/new_project/releases/latest)
* Download the zip file for the latest release to your Documents folder

---

## Exercise

.left-column[
* We are going to attempt to generate the paragraph and NMDS plot from [Figure 4](http://aem.asm.org/content/79/17/5112.full) of the Kozich AEM study
* Rename the folder `Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013`
* We'll set up the project by following along with the instructions in the [`INSTRUCTIONS`](https://github.com/SchlossLab/new_project/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md) file
]

## Modify README.md

* Open the README.md document in an editor
* Remove the first line, which starts "Download... "
* Edit the following lines as you see appropriate:
```sh
## TITLE OF YOUR PAPER GOES HERE
YOUR PAPER'S ABSTRACT GOES HERE
```
* Replace the word `study` in `study.Rmd`, `study.md`, `study.tex`, and `study.pdf` to be the name of your project (e.g. `Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.`)
* We'll leave the rest as it is for now

---

## Changing Filenames

* At the terminal do the following...
```bash
mv submission/study.Rmd submission/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.Rmd
mv submission/study.md submission/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.md
mv submission/study.tex submission/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.rex
mv submission/study.pdf submission/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.pdf
mv newproject_LICENSE.md LICENSE.md
```
* This is doing two things:
	1. Renaming the `study.*` files as we said we would in the `README.md` file
  2. Replacing the license ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)) of the `new_project` repository with a license for your analysis ([MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License))

???

* Go ahead and read and edit the license to include your name and the year
* Note that the MIT license is a permissive license that allows anyone to use your code. This is generally viewed a A Good Thing.
* It would be worth talking with your researh group and PI about what license you want to use.
* Don't think you'll be making money off this repository :)
---

## Getting ready for `git`

* At the terminal do the following:
```bash
git init ./
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
* This is putting your new project under version control using `git`

---

## Connecting with GitHub

* Go to your home page on GitHub
* Create a new repository as you did before with the paper airplane example
* This time...
  * Give the repository the same name as your project (i.e. `Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013`).
  * Keep the repository public
  * Don't initialize with a `README` or `.gitignore` files or a license (you've already got those)

## Connecting with GitHub

* Copy and paste into the terminal the two lines that were highlighted with the red arrow on the previous slide

```bash
Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git
Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013 $ git push -u origin master

## Cleaning up

* Remove the instructions file and commit
```bash
git rm INSTRUCTIONS.md
git commit -m "Remove instructions document"
git push
```
* Refresh your GitHub page and make sure the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file goes away
* If you ever need the information in the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file, you can retreive it from the [`new_project` repository](https://github.com/SchlossLab/new_project/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

---

## Let's go!

* You need...
  * The data... (hint: grab the data from the "Without genomes/metagenomes" link)
  * The references...
  * The text (for the figure lengend and the paragraph titled, "Scaling up")
* Obtain the files and put them in the correct locations
