## Learning goals

* **Primary:** Appreciate the value of automating analyses

--

* **Secondary:**
	*
	*
	*

---

## Learning outcomes

* Develop `bash` scripts to automate analyses

---

## Driver script: Refresher from Noble

* "Record every operation that you perform"
* "Comment generously"
* "~~Avoid~~[DO NOT] editing intermediate files by hand"
* Use a driver script to centralize all processing and analysis
* "Use relative pathways [relative to the project root]"
* "Make the script restartable"

???

* Much of this is driven by automation
* There are many ways to automate these types of analyses, but in this session, we'll focus on using tools within the terminal (i.e. `bash`) to do what we want

---

## "Record every operation that you perform"

* Any analysis you are likely to perform once, you'll probably perform twice
--

* Your mental model should be that someone is going to download your repository and try to rerun your analyes
--

  * Alternatively: if someone nukes the contents of the data folders, how would they regenerate figure 1?
--

  * Alternatively: if you go home for the night, can you keep working without having to be at the computer?
--

* If this is not possible you must take explicit notes that are available for others

---

## "Comment generously"

* In `bash` and many scripting languages you can comment your code with a `#`
* Recall the previous discussion about making your code readable and self documenting
* At a minimum, each script or section of a script should have a header that indicates the inputs and outputs

---

## "~~Avoid~~[DO NOT] editing intermediate files by hand"

* If you start from raw files or files that are downloaded, your script provides the provenance for each derivative data file
--

* Going back to the paper airplane example, imagine how much more uniform, reproducbile, and fast their construction would be if it could be programmed
---

## "Use relative pathways"

1. `/User/pschloss/Documents/ Kozich_ReAnalysis_mBio_2013/data/raw/README.md` is the **absolute** path to the `README.md` file in the `data/raw` directory on **my computer**
2. `Kozich_ReAnalysis_mBio_2013/data/raw/README.md` is the **relative** path to the `README.md` file in the `data/raw` directory of **my project**
3. `REAMDE.md` is a file (let's assume it's within 'data/raw')

--

.center.alert[Why *relative paths*?]

???

* What happens if *you* were to look for a file in the path for example 1? It would crash because you are unlikely to have `/User/pschloss`
* Option 2 is the best option because as long as someone has the Kozich_Re
* Option 3 works, but it assumes that you have used `cd` to get to the correct directory. This is a big assumption, especially if someone else is using your code

---

## "Make the script restartable"

* We'll save this for later when we learn about `make`
* The idea is that if we only change the script to plot the ordination data, we shouldn't have to re-download a bunch of files and start over

---

## Reality

* Most bioinformatics tools (e.g. `mothur`, `QIIME`, `velvet`, etc.) are run from the command line - they are not meant to be interactive
* You probably do not want to run these tools on your laptop; need to run on a computer cluster
* Few clusters will let you run programs interactively. You will submit "jobs", which are special scripts

---

## `bash` scripts

* These can be very straight forward or very complex. Let's keep them straight forward
--

* A script file is little more than a text file that contains commands you would otherwise run from the command prompt
--

* Let's return to `Kozich_ReAnalysis_mBio_2013` and add the download scripts to a new driver script. Be sure to add comments!

```bash
# Download the raw data and put them into the data/raw directory

wget --no-check-certificate https://www.mothur.org/MiSeqDevelopmentData/StabilityNoMetaG.tar
tar xvf StabilityNoMetaG.tar -C data/raw/
rm StabilityNoMetaG.tar


# Download the SILVA reference file (v.123). We will pull out the bacteria-specific sequences and
# clean up the directories to remove the extra files

wget http://mothur.org/w/images/1/15/Silva.seed_v123.tgz
tar xvzf Silva.seed_v123.tgz silva.seed_v123.align silva.seed_v123.tax
mothur "#get.lineage(fasta=silva.seed_v123.align, taxonomy=silva.seed_v123.tax, taxon=Bacteria);degap.seqs(fasta=silva.seed_v123.pick.align, processors=8)"
mv silva.seed_v123.pick.align data/references/silva.seed.align
rm Silva.seed_v123.tgz silva.seed_v123.*
rm mothur.*.logfile

# Download the RDP taxonomy references (v14), put the necessary files in data/references, and
# clean up the directories to remove the extra files

wget -N http://www.mothur.org/w/images/8/88/Trainset14_032015.pds.tgz
tar xvzf Trainset14_032015.pds.tgz trainset14_032015.pds/trainset14_032015.pds.*
mv trainset14_032015.pds/* data/references/
rmdir trainset14_032015.pds
rm Trainset14_032015.pds.tgz
```

* Save this as `analysis_driver.bash` in the project root
* Notice that the `mv` move the data using relative paths (e.g. `data/references/`)

???
* To make this a proper `bash` script we need to add the "shebang" line at the top of the script

---

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Download the raw data and put them into the data/raw directory

wget --no-check-certificate https://www.mothur.org/MiSeqDevelopmentData/StabilityNoMetaG.tar
tar xvf StabilityNoMetaG.tar -C data/raw/

<br>
We can run this from the project root (maybe not now?)...

```bash
bash analysis_driver.bash
```

---

## Now what?

## Let's crank through `mothur`

Look at the files in `code/`
```bash
$ ls code/
README.md         get_good_seqs.batch     mothur
get_error.batch   get_shared_otus.batch   test
```

<br>
* The three `*.batch` files are `mothur` scripts.
* If you aren't familiar with `mothur` or what's going on in the following scripts, please see the [MiSeq SOP](https://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) wiki page
---

## `get_good_seqs.batch`

```bash
make.file(inputdir=data/raw, type=gz, prefix=stability)
make.contigs(file=current, inputdir=data/raw/, outputdir=data/mothur/, processors=8, rename=F)
screen.seqs(fasta=current, group=current, maxambig=0, maxlength=275, maxhomop=8)
unique.seqs(fasta=current)
count.seqs(name=current, group=current, processors=4)
align.seqs(fasta=current, reference=data/references/silva.v4.align, processors=8)
screen.seqs(fasta=current, count=current, start=1968, end=11550)
filter.seqs(fasta=current, vertical=T, trump=.)
unique.seqs(fasta=current, count=current)
pre.cluster(fasta=current, count=current, diffs=2, processors=4)
chimera.uchime(fasta=current, count=current, dereplicate=T, processors=4)
remove.seqs(fasta=current, accnos=current)
classify.seqs(fasta=current, count=current, reference=data/references/trainset14_032015.pds.fasta, taxonomy=data/references/trainset14_032015.pds.tax, cutoff=80, processors=8)
remove.lineage(fasta=current, count=current, taxonomy=current, taxon=Chloroplast-Mitochondria-unknown-Archaea-Eukaryota)
```

* Notice the use of relative paths
* The only thing we may want to change here is the `prefix=stability` option on the first line
* Looking at all of the filenames is everything in good shape?

???

We don't have a `data/references/silva.v4.align` file yet

---

## Let's add some code

* We need `data/references/sliva.v4.align`

```bash
# Generate a customized version of the SILVA reference database that targets the V4 region
mothur "#pcr.seqs(fasta=data/references/silva.seed.align, start=11894, end=25319, keepdots=F, processors=8)"
mv data/references/silva.seed.pcr.align data/references/silva.v4.align
```

* For now, copy/paste these lines into your terminal and let them run
* When you do this for "real" you'll probably want to get to the end of building the file and re-run the entire document to make sure it all works

---

## Run the script through `mothur`

* Now we're ready to run `get_good_seqs.batch` so we can add that to `analysis_driver.batch`

```bash
# Run mothur through the various quality control steps
code/mothur/mothur code/get_good_seqs.batch
```

* Again, go ahead and copy and paste this line into your terminal and let it run

---

## Next script: `get_error.batch`

```bash
set.current(inputdir=data/mothur, outputdir=data/mothur, processors=8)
get.groups(count=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.uchime.pick.pick.count_table, fasta=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.fasta, taxonomy=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.v4.wang.pick.taxonomy, groups=MOCK-MOCK2)
seq.error(fasta=current, count=current, reference=data/references/HMP_MOCK.v4.fasta, aligned=F, processors=8)
```

* Everything looks good. Of course we'd need to change *stability* to whatever we used a prefix in `make.files`

--

<br>
Let's add this to `analysis_driver.bash`

```bash
# Run mock community data through mothur to calculate the sequencing error rates
code/mothur/mothur code/get_error.batch
```

* Again, go ahead and copy and paste this line into your terminal and let it run

---

## Breather...

* At this point, we've run the data through most of the [MiSeq SOP](https://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) wiki page
* We have the error rate data
* We still need to...
  * rarefy the data to get OTU number
  * calculate distances between communities and generate NMDS data

---

## Let's go ahead and commit our work so far....

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   analysis_driver.bash

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add analysis_driver.bash
$ git commit -m "Load pre-baked mothur batch scripts to driver script"
```

---

## Build NMDS data file

* Create a new file `get_nmds_data.batch`. Where should it go?

```bash
set.current(inputdir=data/mothur, outputdir=data/mothur, processors=8)
dist.shared(shared=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.pick.opti_mcc.shared, calc=thetayc, subsample=3000, iters=100, processors=8)
nmds(phylip=current, maxdim=2)
```

--

<br>
Let's add this to `analysis_driver.bash`

```bash
# Generate nmds axes file for plotting from shared file
code/mothur/mothur code/get_nmds_data.batch
```

* Again, go ahead and copy and paste this line into your terminal and let it run

---

[master 7ec81e3] Add code to generate NMDS axes file
 2 files changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 code/get_nmds_data.batch
```

* I'll leave it to you to rarefy the shared file to generate the number of observed OTUs from each sample

---

## Where are we now?

* We have the raw data to attempt to regenerate the figure
* Our repository is up to date (go ahead and `push`)
* You *should* do `bash analysis_driver.bash` to make sure the pieces all fit together

--

<br>
* .alert[Why would that be painful?]

--
  * .alert[Big data -> Slow data]
	* .alert[We've already run these commands!]
	* .alert[Remember this when we get to `make`]
