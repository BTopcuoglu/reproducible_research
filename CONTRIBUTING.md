# Contributing to the Riffomonas Reproducible Research tutorial series

We love to get feedback and improvements from others. That's the idea behind Riffomonas - that we riff on each other's work to make it better! If you would like to contribute to the project or even ask a question, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/riffomonas/reproducible_research/issues">file an issue</a> on our <a href="https://github.com/riffomonas/reproducible_research">GitHub repository</a>. A few preliminary thoughts before you post...

* Be nice. We follow the [Code of Conduct developed by The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
* If you would like to make a change that is anything more than fixing typos, please first file an issue and make sure that it's something that we would be likely to support if you go through the trouble of making the changes
* Recall the steps for creating good issues or pull requests that we discussed in the tutorial series ([Checklist from Mozilla](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/contrib.html)):
  * Maximum submission length of 400 lines
  * Maximum function length of 50 lines
  * Code must be automatically merged
  * All tests must pass
  * All functions must be tested
  * All functions must be documented
  * Respect the style guide
  * Indicate what issue this contribution addresses
  * Summarize and annotate changes
* If you are experiencing an error in running the code that is included in the tutorial, please give an explicit description of the code that is giving the error and what the error message is.

If you're cool with all this, delete this message and file your issue!
